This directory contains all projects further testing the understanding and concepts in dynamic memory allocation, including automatic allocation using memory allocation(malloc), calloc(contiguous allocation), reallocation(realloc), and free, it's meaning, usage, application and implementation in C programming.

This project would also help understand the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, how to use malloc and free, the reason for the usage of malloc, how to use 'valgrind' to check for memory leak, and if the results of malloc are usually casted.

Resources utilized to learn this concept - Malloc
