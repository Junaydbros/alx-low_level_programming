This directory contains all projects testing the basic understanding and concepts in dynamic memory allocation using memory allocation(malloc), calloc(contiguous allocation), reallocation(realloc), and free, it's meaning, usage, application and implementation in C programming.

This project also helped to understand the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, how to use malloc and free, the reason for the usage of malloc, and how to use 'valgrind' to check for memory leak.

Resources utilized to learn this concept - Malloc specifically
